# sei-project-2.github.io
***Purchases Diary Project***

***Technologies Used***
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Heroku App Deployment
- Mongodb

***Approach***

1. I wanted to have a fucntioning app that allowed me to track my own purchases and log them, allowing me to pull info from this and keep a better form of record keeping for the future.
2. Began setup with Heroku deployment, Mongo setup, and my CRUD requests as a baseline. The moved to the connection side, then onto user login and sign up.
3. Lastly I set up my views and worked on CSS for the project. In hindsight it may be nice to build out my CSS before most else to make things easier in the long run.

***Future Adjustments***

This is an app that I would actually like to spend more time on in order to use for myself! The information I can store and and add for future use is very helpful to me with some things that I am working on outside of class. This work-in-progress project will, upon completion, serve as an excellent tool for me to be able to filter/sort through purchases by specific parameters, calculate short/long term gains and losses, and provide other relevant statistics to help me better understand my own portfolio.
